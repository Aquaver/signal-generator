# Signal Generator

Signal Generator is a project of a GUI application based on Qt framework, which allows generating signal models that are representations of periodic waveforms (for instance electrical ones) in four main ways - as sinusoidal, square, triangular and sawtooth waveform. This program uses a simple class hierarchy consisting of an abstract base class which defines mathematical model of a signal, and three subclasses implementing sine, square and triangular (including sawtooth) waveforms. In addition, a class which comes from part of project that was generated by Qt, used to handle graphical user interface, realizes `use` relation between itself and these classes when generating waveforms, to transform the mathematical model into graphical representation of the signal.
