# Signal Generator

Signal Generator is a project of a GUI application based on Qt framework, which allows generating signal models that are representations of periodic waveforms (for instance electrical ones) in four main ways - as sinusoidal, square, triangular and sawtooth waveform. This program uses a simple class hierarchy consisting of an abstract base class which defines mathematical model of a signal, and three subclasses implementing sine, square and triangular (including sawtooth) waveforms. In addition, a class which comes from part of project that was generated by Qt, used to handle graphical user interface, realizes `use` relation between itself and these classes when generating waveforms, to transform the mathematical model into graphical representation of the signal.

## Class structure implementation

Application's main logic part consists of header files with field and method definitions, and specific for this language - separate source files with implementation of that class methods (including mathematical model functions) for generated waveforms.

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <QtGlobal>
#include <QVector>

class Signal {
  public:
    bool isSelected = false;

    QVector<qreal> getArguments();
    QVector<qreal> getValues();

    void setArguments(QVector<qreal> newArguments);
    qint32 signalLength(); // Returns length of arguments/values set (they should be equal - if not then this function returns -1 which means an error).

  protected:
    static qreal shiftX, shiftY;

    QVector<qreal> arguments;
    QVector<qreal> values;

    virtual qreal signalFunction(qreal argument) = 0; // Master signal function (mathematical model) which converts an argument into proper value.
    virtual void calculateValues(); // Computes values vector from arguments vector.

  private:
    bool valuesValid = false;
    friend class CompoundSignal;
};
```

The first class, which is the base abstract one for all types of waveforms is named `Signal` and its body is implemented in its own file. It consists of fields that define behavior of each possible generated signal and simple operations that can be performed on them, such as setting a set of arguments, computing values and retrieving that set of calculated values for this waveform. In addition, a `friend` relationship with another class `CompoundSignal` is also defined here, to allow access to private fields of this class and implement creating compound waveforms.
